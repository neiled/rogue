## To Do
* ~~Random Map~~

* ~~Multiple Levels~~
* ~~Exploring~~
* NPCs - *In Progress*
* Theme
* Combat
* Health
* Items/Weapons
* Magic


## Notes

### Scoring

Scoring should be done for particularly difficult things:
* New Dungeon level
* Beating your own score is classed as a win, not a loss.

### Combat

### Weapons
* Diablo style +3 agility weapons.
* Varying on rarity
* Respawned monsters (if we have them) should not spawn anything other than normal weapons - no farming allowed.

### Other
* Some form of seeing your past deaths? Corpses of previous plays or something...
