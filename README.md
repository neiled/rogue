RogueLike game

Procedural generated map.
Further player goes into the dungeon (lower levels) the harder the game becomes.
? Monsters can keep coming up from the lower levels
Turn based movement. Each time the user moves a 'tick' is calculated.
? Interaction with other players of the game somehow... [Notes?]
