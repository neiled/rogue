## To Do
* ~~Random Map~~
* ~~FOV/Lighting~~
* ~~Multiple Levels~~
* ~~Exploring~~
* ~~NPCs~~
* Theme
* ~~Combat~~
* ~~Health~~
* ~~Items/Weapons~~
* Magic


## Notes

### Scoring

Scoring should be done for particularly difficult things:
* New Dungeon level
* Beating your own score is classed as a win, not a loss.

### Combat

### Weapons
* Diablo style +3 agility weapons.
* Varying on rarity
* Respawned monsters (if we have them) should not spawn anything other than normal weapons - no farming allowed.

### Other
* Some form of seeing your past deaths? Corpses of previous plays or something...
* Keep a diary of events, player can read through previous plays.
* Saving game
* Being able to go back to the surface
* Replaying game (Maybe two game modes, hero and adventure, hero = permadeath).
* Tourches on walls
