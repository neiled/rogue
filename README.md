## Notes

### Scoring

Scoring should be done for particularly difficult things:
* New Dungeon level
* Beating your own score is classed as a win, not a loss.

### Combat

### Weapons
* Diablo style +3 agility weapons.
* Varying on rarity
* Respawned monsters (if we have them) should not spawn anything other than normal weapons - no farming allowed.

### Other
* Some form of seeing your past deaths? Corpses of previous plays or something...
* Keep a diary of events, player can read through previous plays.
* Saving game
* Being able to go back to the surface
* Replaying game (Maybe two game modes, hero and adventure, hero = permadeath).
* Tourches on walls
* Start in town at beginning of the game
* Has shops selling things, will buy players things they found
* Has entrace to the dungeon
* Town scrolls will take player instantly back to town, but one way
* Levels do not refresh, they are perm
* Some artefacts can have origin set to a certain spot in the game so don't always have to teleport back to town, or can teleport back to that spot once returning to town.
* Player death returns to town?
* Tourches take up a hand spot if carried lit
* Find corpses or other adventurers
* Skills with cooldown periods (i.e. charge in a straight line until hit something, does damage, takes 100 turns to cooldown).
*
